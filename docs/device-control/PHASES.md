## Phase 0 — Architecture, Legal, and Schema (2 weeks)

**Goal:** lock the architectural decision record, the license posture,
and the wire schemas before any code lands. This phase is
intentionally short and document-only.

### Deliverables

- ADR landed in PROPOSAL.md § 3.2 (functional port, not source port).
- Fleet capability mapping table landed in PROPOSAL.md § 4.
- License reviews for every reference engine: Fleet (MIT) and Fleet
  EE (proprietary, **excluded**); MakeMeAdmin (GPL, **excluded as
  source**, clean-room reference only); SAP Privileges (clean-room
  reference); Munki (Apache-2.0, clean-room reference); Santa /
  North Pole Santa (Apache-2.0); MeshCentral (Apache-2.0, clean-room
  reference); Tactical RMM (**benchmark-only, never base**).
- Schema specs for `Finding`, `Recommendation`, `SignedActionJob`,
  `ActionResult`, `EvidenceRecord` (PROPOSAL.md § 8 + ARCHITECTURE.md
  § 3) reviewed and stable.
- New `MessageType` and `EventKind` variant lists agreed
  (ARCHITECTURE.md § 2.1, § 4.1).
- Phase 0 exit-criteria document recorded in PROGRESS.md.

## Phase 1 — Visibility + Admin/Root Review (8–12 weeks)

**Goal:** light up steps 1–4 of the SME workflow (inventory + admin
review + outdated software + plain-English findings) with evidence
records flowing for every observation.

### Deliverables

- `sda-device-control` crate scaffolded; signed-job validation
  pipeline in place (returns `JobRefused: NotImplemented` for actions
  not yet supported).
- `sda-query` MVP: scheduled queries via osquery sidecar (Phase 1 is
  sidecar-only).
- `sda-posture` snapshots wired into the event bus and the SMI
  pipeline.
- Local admin / root inventory for Windows / macOS / Linux via the
  new `AdminManager` PAL trait.
- Software inventory delta stream re-exported from
  `sda-enhanced-inventory` as `SoftwareInventoryDelta`.
- Plain-English `Finding` text for the five canonical examples in
  PROPOSAL.md § 2.2.
- SMI sub-scores (Admin hygiene, Patch hygiene, Software allow-list,
  Posture, Vitals, Evidence completeness) wired up by the SN360 SMI
  Engine ⚙️.
- Evidence records for every action result, even no-op acks.
- Device Registry integration ⚙️.
- `sda-agent-vitals` shipping heartbeat + queue depth + watchdog
  faults.

   footprint is bit-for-bit identical to today.
5. Every Phase 1 action that produces a side effect — even an ack —
   emits a signed `EvidenceRecord`.

---

## Phase 2 — Push Software + Approved Catalogue (12–20 weeks)

**Goal:** light up step 5 of the SME workflow (execute approved
fixes safely) for the software-management half of MVP.

### Deliverables

- `sda-software` crate live; signed catalogue manifest verification.
- Per-OS `PackageManager` PAL implementations:
  - Windows: WinGet wrapper.
  - macOS: clean-room Munki-style local repo.
  - Linux: `apt` / `dnf` / `yum` / `zypper` auto-detect.

  enforcement (used for catalogue pre-flight scripts).
- Maintenance-window and quiet-hour enforcement on every install /
  update / uninstall job.
- Package approval states (Approved, Pending, Denied, Recalled)
  surfaced as `Recommendation`s.
- Rollback path for failed updates.
- Evidence records for every install / update / uninstall + every
  rollback.

   one-click patch + evidence + SMI delta on all three platforms.
2. Out-of-window jobs are deferred, never silently executed.
3. Catalogue signature failures produce `JobRefused: SignatureError`
   with structured detail in the evidence record.
4. Existing budgets unchanged.

---

## Phase 3 — Just-in-Time Admin/Root (20–32 weeks)

**Goal:** light up the "User needs admin" example end to end with
auto-revocation, evidence, and SMI feedback.

### Deliverables

- `sda-jit-admin` crate live; revocation watchdog operational.
- Per-OS temporary admin grant via `AdminManager`:
  - Windows: time-boxed group membership + scheduled revoke.
  - macOS: SAP Privileges-style flow (clean-room).
  - Linux: time-boxed `sudoers.d` drop-in via `visudo`.
- Auto-approval and human-approval workflows ⚙️.
- Revocation triggers: explicit revoke, time-out, logout, suspend,
  heartbeat loss, idempotent revoke on boot.
- Drift detection: out-of-band group changes flagged.
- Evidence record at every transition (Requested / Granted / Revoked
  / Drift).

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 3.1 | `sda-pal::AdminManager` impls — temporary | Time-boxed grant + revoke on each OS. | Not Started |
| 3.2 | `sda-jit-admin` scaffold | Crate skeleton + grant state machine. | Not Started |
| 3.3 | Revocation watchdog | Tokio task scheduling + multi-trigger revoke. | Not Started |
| 3.4 | Boot-time idempotent revoke | On startup, revoke any expired grants. | Not Started |
| 3.5 | Drift detection | Compare observed grants vs. tracked grants; emit Finding. | Not Started |
| 3.6 | Approval Service v1 ⚙️ | Auto + human + per-tenant policy. Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |

| 3.8 | Phase 3 E2E suite | Covers PROPOSAL.md § 2.2 example 5 end to end. | Not Started |

### Acceptance criteria

1. The "User needs admin" example completes the loop: signed-job
   grant → time-boxed admin → automatic revoke → evidence → SMI.
2. No grant outlives its TTL under any failure mode (process crash,
   reboot, network loss, sleep/wake).
3. Drift detection finds operator-side group changes within one
   posture-snapshot interval.

---

## Phase 4 — Remote Support + App Control + MDM Connectors (32–48 weeks)

**Goal:** broaden the surface to the "Integrate later" bucket from
PROPOSAL.md § 2.3.

### Deliverables

- `sda-remote-support` crate live with consent banner, time-bounded
  sessions, and clean-room MeshCentral-style protocol.
- `sda-app-control` crate live in **monitor** mode (default); enforce
  mode opt-in per tenant.
- macOS app control via Santa / North Pole Santa.
- Windows app control via WDAC + AppLocker via PowerShell + signed
  policies.
- Linux app control via clean-room dm-verity-aware enforcement.
- Mobile MDM connectors ⚙️:
  - Android: Google Android Management API + Headwind reference.
  - Apple: NanoMDM-style service.
  - ChromeOS: Chrome Policy / Chrome Management APIs.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 4.1 | `sda-pal::RemoteSupportProvider` impls | Per-OS capture + transport. | Not Started |
| 4.2 | `sda-remote-support` scaffold | Consent banner, time-bound, protocol shim. | Not Started |
| 4.3 | Clean-room MeshCentral-style protocol | Specification + reference implementation. | Not Started |
| 4.4 | `sda-pal::AppControlProvider` impls | Per-OS app control providers. | Not Started |
| 4.5 | `sda-app-control` scaffold | Monitor mode default + signed policy push. | Not Started |
| 4.6 | Santa integration (macOS) | Wrap Santa's binauthorize / file-modification rules. | Not Started |
| 4.7 | WDAC + AppLocker (Windows) | Signed-policy push via PowerShell. | Not Started |
| 4.8 | Linux app control | Clean-room dm-verity-aware enforcement. | Not Started |
| 4.9 | Android MDM connector ⚙️ | Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 4.10 | Apple MDM/DDM connector ⚙️ | Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 4.11 | ChromeOS connector ⚙️ | Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 4.12 | Phase 4 E2E suite | Remote-support session, app-control monitor + enforce, evidence. | Not Started |

### Acceptance criteria

1. Remote support session cannot start without an explicit user
   click; banner is visible the entire session; ending the session
   removes all access.
2. App control monitor mode is the default; flipping to enforce
   requires per-tenant opt-in + dual-control + a documented rollback
   path.
3. Mobile MDM tasks are wired in `sn360-security-platform` only;
   nothing in this repository runs on Android/iOS.

## Phase 5 — MSP-Ready Multi-Tenant Operations (48+ weeks)

**Goal:** light up step 8 of the SME workflow ("Make it MSP-ready").

### Deliverables

- Tenant-scoped catalogues with shared templates ⚙️.
- Approval routing: per-tenant approver + MSP-tier approver chains ⚙️.
- White-label evidence exports (customer-branded PDF + JSON) ⚙️.
- MSP dashboard ⚙️.
- Cross-tenant templates with per-tenant override hooks ⚙️.
- `sda-management-compat` translation shim for Fleet-flavoured GitOps
  YAML so existing customers can adopt SDA.

### Tasks

| # | Task | Description | Status |
|---|------|-------------|--------|
| 5.1 | Tenant catalogues ⚙️ | Per-tenant + cross-tenant template catalogues. Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 5.2 | Approval routing ⚙️ | Per-tenant + MSP approver chains. Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 5.3 | White-label exports ⚙️ | Branded PDF + JSON evidence exports. Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |
| 5.4 | MSP dashboard ⚙️ | Cross-tenant operational view. Implemented in `sn360-security-platform`. | Not Started |

| 5.6 | `sda-management-compat` shim | Translate Fleet-flavoured GitOps YAML into SDA-native config. | Not Started |
| 5.7 | Phase 5 E2E suite | Cross-tenant scenario coverage. | Not Started |

### Acceptance criteria

1. No agent-side change is required to onboard an MSP tenant; the
   agent is unaware of MSP topology.
2. Cross-tenant data leakage is impossible by construction (existing
   Postgres RLS + per-tenant signing keys + agent-side `tenant_id`
   validation).
3. White-label exports never include another tenant's `tenant_id` or
   evidence.
